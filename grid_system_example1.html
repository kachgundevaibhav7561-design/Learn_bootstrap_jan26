                            often eaten as a snack food. They are also used in the production of cooking oil, as food
                            for livestock, as bird food, and as plantings in domestic gardens for aesthetics. Wild

                                <p>
                                    Tradition and History: Pune was a central hub of the Maratha Empire and experienced
                                    major growth under the rule of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and the Peshwas. Places
                                    such as Shaniwar Wada and Lal Mahal, which are historical landmarks, bear witness to
                                    the rich history of Pune. It was Lokmanya Tilak who started the Ganesh festival in
                                    Pune, and thus the city became a place for great celebration of Ganesh Chaturthi.
